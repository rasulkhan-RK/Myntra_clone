# Myntra Clone (React, Redux, Node.js)

This project is a basic Myntra clone built using React, Redux Toolkit, and a Node.js backend. It serves as a practice project to understand the flow of a full-stack application, including front-end (React) state management with Redux Toolkit and back-end (Node.js) setup for basic functionality.
